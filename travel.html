                <p>I took my first plane ride before I took my first steps.</p>   
                                          
                <p>Each place gave me the opportunity to learn from many different cultures and traditions, as well as people from all walks of life.</p>

                <p>In fact, it is travelling the world which also greatly shaped my <a href="research.html">path towards neuroscience</a>.</p>

                <p>Let me take you through my life of travel, showing you the beautiy of each place and my favorite thing about it.</p>
