                <h3>Background</h3>
            
                <p>My name is Irina Djuraskovic and I was born in <time datetime="2002">2002</time> in Bar, Montenegro.</p>    

                <p>Not long after, my family moved to Italy, and we have been moving ever since.</p>   
                        
                <p>To learn more about my travels, please visit my travel page!</p>
                    
                <p>I am now a graduating senior majoring in Neuroscience with a minor in Chemistry and Computer science at <abbr title="University of Miami">UM</abbr></p>

                <p>For more detailed experiences and qualifications I obtained in the field so far, feel free to look at my resume</p>

                <h3>Why Neuroscience</h3>
                
                <p>I took my first plane ride before my first steps. Never in one country for more than 5 years, my whole life, I have been learning from the diversity this world has to offer. 
                    Through traveling, I recognized how despite differing healthcare systems and socioeconomic climates around the world, the stigma and helplessness associated with neurological disorders remained. 
                    Given the limited preventions and treatments for many neurological disabilities, society often unjustly marginalizes affected people. 
                    I believe I can best help redefine what many have deemed helpless by pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience. 
                </p>

                <h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
                
                <p>
                    I plan to use and further build on these computational foundations to help deepen our understanding of both biological and artificial neural networks and to develop brain machine interfaces and neural prosthetics.
                    Living in a time where vast amounts and types of data are being generated, I am also interested in developing techniques to analyze this data, uncovering patterns and correlations which could answer some of neuroscience’s unanswered questions.
                    A PhD’s commitment to scientific exploration both in terms of the breadth of topics being investigated and the flexibility offered to its students to choose the right laboratory aligns closely with my values and future goals. 
                </p>

                <p>Some of the fields I am particularly interested in:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Neuromotor Engineering</li>
                    <li>Neurorehabilitation</li>
                    <li>Computational Neuroscience</li>
                    <li>Clinical Neuroscience</li>
                </ul>
